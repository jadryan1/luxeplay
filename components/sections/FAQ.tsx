    question: "How far in advance should I book?",
    answer:
      "We recommend booking at least 2-3 weeks in advance for weekday events and 4-6 weeks for weekend events, especially during peak season (spring and fall). For holiday weekends and December events, we suggest booking 2-3 months ahead. However, we always try to accommodate last-minute requests when our schedule allows.",

Within 7 days, we offer credit toward a future booking. We also offer event date changes with no penalty when possible.",
